When building my portfolio I wanted to use a new framework. I have been working with NextJS these past three years and while the framework is great, I felt like I was getting stuck in only one way of thinking. I also ditched tailwind and opted to use plain old CSS.

### Why build a portfolio/blog ?

For the past three years since my first son was born, I haven't been reading much. Another reason is that I have been pushing myself to read more nonfiction. Recently, I decided to return to my favorite genre: Science Fiction. I had two books I wanted to read and didn’t know where to start. So, I asked my wife to choose for me. She chose Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes.

During the first 20 pages, my joy for reading came back, and I got really invested in the book. I read it almost every night before bed.

> “Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from dakness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den" - Plato

This book deals with themes of isolation, family ostracism, social mockery, childhood trauma, sex, depression and love. Keyes' ability to make you empathize with the protagonist makes this book a gut-wrenching read.

P.S - I give this book 4.8/5 stars.
