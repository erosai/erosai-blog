I always have a sense of calmness when reading a book. Having my â€˜brain voiceâ€™ narrate something to myself using words that someone much more skilled than me has written, is a truly relaxing experience.

Writing something is a bit different, you come face to face with the vagueness and slowness of your thoughts. You realize that you do most of your inner monologue as if writting with autocomplete. That is one of the reasons I have decided to start writing.

I donâ€™t really want to categorize my blog as I intend to write about everything that is of interest to me. I will be tagging my blogs so that you , if someone actually ever reads this, the reader have an easier time navigating and finding something that might be of interest to you.

Just to make sure if someone actually reads this, I will be implementing an â€˜I was here and I read this â€˜ type of functionality. So if you were here and you read this, please let me know.
